                  <p>NEPSE the only Stock Exchange in Nepal has replaced the open cry trading system with fully automated screen based trading since 24th August, 2007 under the CFG project of Government of Nepal aided by Asian Development Bank.</p>
                  
                    <p>The NEPSE trading system is called NEPSE Automated Trading System (NATS) is a fully automated screen based trading system, which adopts the principle of an order driven market.</p>
                  
                      <p>According to this system, when there are two orders placed for a security in the market, the system matches the best buy order with the best sell order. An order may match partially with another order producing multiple trades.</p>
                  
                        <p>For order matching the best buy order is the one with the highest price and the best sell order is the one with the lowest price. This is because the system views all buy orders available from the point of view of the sellers and all sell orders from the point of view of the buyers in the market.</p>
                  
                          <p>So, of all buy orders available in the market at any point of time, a seller would obviously like to sell at the highest possible buy price that is offered. Hence, the best buy order is the order with the highest price and the best sell order is the order with the lowest price.</p>

                  <p>Small groups of individuals buy stock in a misinformed way. Then when its price rises, they sell it at a profit. The method works best in bull markets when people are most sensitive to greed. It is also most powerful when used on the small traded share with few buyers.</p>
                  <p>Do better calculations before taking any decision before buy and sell the stock in Nepal online. Just use Share Calculator and get the best analysis of when to sell it and return on investment.</p>
