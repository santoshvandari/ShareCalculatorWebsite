                <p>NEPSE the only Stock Exchange in Nepal has replaced the open cry trading system with fully automated
                  screen based trading since 24th August, 2007 under the CFG project of Government of Nepal aided by
                  Asian Development Bank.</p>

                <p>The NEPSE trading system is called NEPSE Automated Trading System (NATS) is a fully automated screen
                  based trading system, which adopts the principle of an order driven market.</p>

                <p>According to this system, when there are two orders placed for a security in the market, the system
                  matches the best buy order with the best sell order. An order may match partially with another order
                  producing multiple trades.</p>

                <p>For order matching the best buy order is the one with the highest price and the best sell order is
                  the one with the lowest price. This is because the system views all buy orders available from the
                  point of view of the sellers and all sell orders from the point of view of the buyers in the market.
                </p>

                <p>So, of all buy orders available in the market at any point of time, a seller would obviously like to
                  sell at the highest possible buy price that is offered. Hence, the best buy order is the order with
                  the highest price and the best sell order is the order with the lowest price.</p>

                <p>Small groups of individuals buy stock in a misinformed way. Then when its price rises, they sell it

                  most powerful when used on the small traded share with few buyers.</p>

                <p>Order is an expression of interest to either buy or sell a specified quantity of stock either at a
                  specified price or at the current market price. To make any buying and selling activities of the
                  securities in the secondary market, the investors must go through the channel of Brokers as per the
                  Securities Exchange Act of 1983; this act also prohibited these brokers to make transactions without
                  getting orders from their clients.
                </p>
                <p>So before an investors wants to involve in the activities of buying and selling of securities, s/he
                  first need to register in the broker terminal as a client for which certain information and documents
                  need to be provided to broker through which client code, unique code of the particular client for a
                  particular broker, is generated.
                </p>
                <p>After registering, in future date if a broker receives the order then the broker has to place order
                  for that client on FIFO basis of the order registered by the client’s in the broker’s office. The
                  orders can be Buy and Sell order.

                <li><strong>Buy Order</strong></li>
                <p>It is the order placed by buying brokers to purchase the securities on behalf of his
                  clients/investors. In this order, s/he has to mention clearly the name of the companies, the number of
                  securities that s/he wants to buy and the validity of the orders. If the validity period of the order
                  is not mentioned, it will be valid for only 15 days.

                  <li><strong>Sell Order</strong></li>
                <p>It is the order placed by the selling client to the broker to execute the transactions. In this order
                  too, the client has to mention the name of the company, number of securities, prices of the securities
                  that s/he wants to sell for and the validity period of the orders. If the validity period of the order
                  is not mentioned, it will be valid for only 15 days.
